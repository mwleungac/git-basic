Difference between add, commit, and push:
git add: adds your modified files to the queue to be committed later. Files are not yet committed.
git commit: commits the files that have been added and creates a new revision with a log. If you do not add any files, git will not commit anything.
git push: pushes your changes to the remote repository.
